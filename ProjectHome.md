gCode SL stands for Generic Code Scripting Language. Currently under development, gCode SL supports a unique form of scripting, based partially off C#.

gCode uses gInclude, an functionally unrelated generic include developed by gsglive.com. We have procured permission to release their DLL with our code.

Recently, gCode SL IDE has been developed and released, open source. This allows you to script better in gCode; all recognized methods will turn dark blue, and all recognized parameters will turn blue. Please note that this is a tentative application, and is so subject to change. This IDE can be customized by using the method gCodeSL.XMLInteract.GenerateIDE included in the DLL.
